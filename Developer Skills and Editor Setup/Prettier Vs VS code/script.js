// But now I want to show you something else, which is to basically automate something very boring
// that we're doing all the time. And that is writing console.log.
// So whenever we want to log something, we have to write console.log
// but in VS Code, we can configure snippets, which can take that work away from us.

// So let me show you how.
// So we go here in the file menu into this Preferences sub menu
// and then here we can define Snippets. So click on that.

// And then you can open one of these files but the best thing to do
// is to just create a New Global Snippets File. So click that and then just give it a name
// and it doesn't really matter. I'm just gonna call it jonas here.

// And so here we can define a couple of snippets and remember that the snippet
// that we want to define is simply one that automatically writes console.log for us.

// Changes made in the snippet

// whenever I write now cl and then hit Enter,
// it will give me console.log.
