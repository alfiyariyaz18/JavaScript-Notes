// And we can actually use Live Server in two different ways. First, we can install a VS Code extension,
// or second, we can use a bit of a more professional workflow using Node.js and a so-called npm package.

//  there is a more professional way of running Live Server
// which just by using something called Node.jS, which is a JavaScript runtime
// that we can install on our computers.

//  So let's now quickly go ahead and install Node.js on our computers.
// Now, anyway, after you successfully installed Node.js, it will become available as a program
// in the so-called terminal. and let's use the VS Code built-in terminal.

// So VS code has a terminal included and to open it,
// we need to go to the menu bar, terminal and then new terminal.
// And then I will clear this terminal here by hitting Command or Control + K.

// But anyway, in case you're not familiar with the terminal,
// it is basically a way of giving a computer instructions. And we will learn more about the terminal
// later in the course. This not the point to worry about a terminal.

// All I want you to do is to write node -v, then hit Return or Enter.
// And then you should see some kind of number here. It doesn't matter what number,
// but as long as you see a number, it means that you successfully installed Node.js
// So if you have this number here then you can now write npm install live-server -g.

// use clear command to clear the terminal

// And now all we need to do

// is to write live-server and then hit Return.
