// Now its time to start adding behavior to our website by learning and using just a little bit of JavaScript.
// So for example we can write something like alert, and then we're going to open up some round brackets or parentheses, 
// and we're going to tell it what we want it to alert us.

// So let's just get it to write "Hello".

// And then at the end we're going to close everything off with this semi-colon.
// So now if I hit Enter, Chrome will run this line of code,
// and as you can see it brings up a pop-up, and that pop-up has the message of "Hello".
// Now if you hit OK the pop-up will disappear and that is the end of our alert.

alert("Hello");

// Now the alert in this case is a keyword, and the keywords are special.
// You can't just use any word you wish.

// It has to be something that the browser knows about. And in this case the browser knows 
// that when you write alert you're trying to tell it to create a pop-up.
// And this is also known as a function because it's a little bit of functionality.
// It gets the browser to do something, not like what we've done so far, which is just to change the appearance
// of the website,

// this is actually a little bit of behavior which we got by writing JavaScript code.

// The middle part here is the message. This is what we want to show up in the pop-up 
// and you can change that message to anything you wish and it doesn't matter what you write,

// And finally at the end there is this semi-colon and that denotes the end of this sentence or the end
// of your instruction, so that the browser doesn't get confused between one line and the next line and
// doesn't combine it into a single line of instruction.
